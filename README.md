## Description

This module will install and configure FreeIPA servers, replicas, and clients.

## Setup

### What Freeipa Pupppet module affects

The module should not affect a previous installation of FreeIPA, it should fail trying.

Below are all items that module can affect:

 * Modifiy /etc/hosts (if `$freeipa::manage_host_entry` true)

 * Install the following packages if not present: autofs, bind-dyndb-ldap, epel-release, sssd-common, sssdtools, ipa-client, ipa-server, ipa-server-dns, openldap-clients

Installation of Freeipa server will obviously install a ntp server, a DNS server, a LDAP Directory, a Kerberos server, apache, Certmonger and PKI Tomcat.

### Setup Requirements

This module requires :

  * `puppetlabs-stdlib`

  * `puppet-epel`

Versions are given in `metadata.json` file.

### How does the module work.

Usually with a module, the desired state is described. If a value of parameter is changed, then during the next puppet run the node is modified to reach the desired state.
But, the module is more an idempotent installer of FreeIPA. So changing a value of parameter does not change the value on the node.

## Usage

### Examples of usage:

Deploy an IPA master :

```puppet
class {'freeipa':
    ipa_role                    => 'master',
    domain                      => 'example.lan',
    ipa_server_fqdn             => 'ipa-server-1.example.lan',
    puppet_admin_password       => 'secret_abc',
    directory_services_password => 'secret_dir',
    install_ipa_server          => true,
    ip_address                  => '10.10.10.35',
    enable_ip_address           => true,
    enable_hostname             => true,
    manage_host_entry           => true,
    install_epel                => true,
    ipa_master_fqdn             => 'ipa-server-1.example.lan',
}
```

Add a replica:

The initial password of `admin` user have expiration set to 3 months. So, if the expiration is not handled and a replica is deployed after this limit, it is impossible to get kerberos TGT. And so the replica deployment fail (Note: the installer send an error message about network issue).

```puppet
class {'freeipa':
    ipa_role             => 'replica',
    domain               => 'example.lan',
    ipa_server_fqdn      => 'ipa-server-2.example.lan',
    domain_join_password => 'vagrant123',
    install_ipa_server   => true,
    ip_address           => '10.10.10.36',
    enable_ip_address    => true,
    enable_hostname      => true,
    manage_host_entry    => true,
    install_epel         => true,
    ipa_master_fqdn      => 'ipa-server-1.example.lan',
}
```

Add a client:

```puppet
class {'freeipa':
    ipa_role                    => 'client',
    domain                      => 'example.lan',
    password_usedto_joindomain  => 'vagrant123',
    install_epel                => true,
    directory_services_password => 'vagrant123',
    ipa_master_fqdn             => 'ipa.example.lan',
    puppet_admin_password       => 'vagrant123',
    ip_address                  => $ipaddress,
    ipa_master_fqdn             => 'ipa-server-1.example.lan',
}
```

Create an admin account with task :

`bolt task run freeipa::manage_admin operator_login='mylogin' operator_password='mysecret' ensure='present' login='jaimarre' firstname='Jean' lastname='Aimarre' password='newadminsecret' --nodes <ipamaster> --modulepath ~/modules`

Delete an admin account with task :

`bolt task run freeipa::manage_admin operator_login='mylogin' operator_password='mysecret' ensure='absent' login='jaimarre' --nodes <ipamaster> --modulepath ~/modules`

### REFERENCE

A full description can be found in `[REFERENCE.md](https://gitlab.adullact.net/adullact/puppet-freeipa/blob/master/REFERENCE.md)`.

## Limitations

This module will not work well if managed passwords contain `'` or `\`. They must be banned.

To deploy a server is only supported on CentOS 7. To deploy a client is supported on CentOS 7, Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04.

Acceptance tests are done :

 * with last available versions of Puppet 5 and Puppet 6 from puppetlabs packages AIO (facter 3 is shiped).

 * with CentOS 7 for FreeIPA master and replica nodes. IPA masters and replicas works only on Centos >= 7.5.

 * with Ubuntu 18.06 for FreeIPA clients .

With follwoing issue not fixed the acceptance tests about tasks are disabled :
https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker-task_helper/issues/47
PR : https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker-task_helper/pull/48


Puppet4 is EOL since 2019-01-01. Even if puppet 4.10 should work, it is not tested.
